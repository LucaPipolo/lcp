p When the first computer, already a star in my house since the '90s, was replaced to make room for a Pentium II revolution, the ill-fated predecessor became my toy. The first step was to take it apart & reassemble it and then notice with surprise and joy that it still worked perfectly. Over time I began to dare more: replacing components, changing cases, overclocking the CPU. So, as a child, I realized that the computer was my passion. 
p When I became a teenager I got in touch with a family friend who worked in the IT sector, so I immersed myself in a world made of XHTML and CSS tags, where Linux replaced Windows and where web development took the place of the hardware tricks. It was clear: the computer was not only my passion but it could become my job. I spent the difficult years of high school between books, many friends and work that took more and more a definite shape until I started to collaborate with companies: first a small one that developed management software using Ruby on Rails, then an advertising agency where creativity was the daily bread.
p In these years Iâ€™ve not only greatly improved my technical skills, but I also lived many experiences that have increasingly stimulated my curiosity about new technologies and beyond. I learned to work in team, to love the differences between each people I met on my path, and to love the uniqueness of the story that everyone builds in their own lives.
p My desire to know, my wish for new experiences and my infinite passion for travel have allowed me to move to Spain, where I started my new great adventure.
